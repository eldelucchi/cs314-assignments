        <p class="aboutMeP">If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. This painting comes right out of your heart. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first.</p>
        <p class="aboutMeP">This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. You have to make these big decisions. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Son of a gun. All kinds of happy little splashes.</p>
